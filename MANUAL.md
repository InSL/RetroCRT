# Installation

[The release page](https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT/releases) has any, and all, pre-built images ready to go.

# Customizing

## Splash Images

We check for several images to display as a splash before loading our game.  In my example, we're loading mspacman.zip under FBA/FBN.  These are all in descending order of preference.

```
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/mspacman-splash.png    <- custom splash image
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/mspacman-splash.jpg    <- custom splash image
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/mspacman-image.png     <- typical thumbnail image from scrapers
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/mspacman-image.jpg     <- typical thumbnail image from scrapers
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/default-splash.png     <- platform-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/fba/images/default-splash.jpg     <- platform-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/splashscreens/default-splash.png  <- system-wide splash
/home/pi/RetroPie/splashscreens/default-splash.jpg  <- system-wide splash
```

## Dynamic Marquee

My GitHub project [RetroPie Marquee](https://github.com/xovox/RetroPieMarquee) may be of some help.

# How Everything Works

## Installation/Updating

This happens in two stages

* retrocrt_setup.sh
  * This prompts the user for information & then generates our configuration file
* RetroCRT.yml
  * This is an Ansible playbook that reads the configuration & applies changes

## Configuration Files

* /home/pi/.retrocrtrc
  * This is the configuration file generated by retrocrt_setup.sh
* /home/pi/RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
  * This contains per-game monitor resolution & orientation information
* /home/pi/RetroCRT/retrocrt_timings/
  * This directory contains display resolutions that we dynamically switch to

## Scripts

files/runcommand-onstart.d/01-splash.sh
files/runcommand-onstart.d/99-retrocrtdebug.sh
files/runcommand-onstart.d/75-set_screen_resolution.sh

### Changing Screen Resolution

This happens before loading a game, and after the game exits.

```
/home/pi/RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
files/runcommand-onend.d/99-set_screen_resolution.sh
/home/pi/RetroCRT/retrocrt_timings/
```

### Generating RetroArch Configuration

We generate a per-game configuration for RetroArch to give it the following:
* Screen horizontal & Vertical resolutions
* Screen orientation
* Any offsets for games that run > 240p

files/runcommand-onstart.d/50-gen_ra_config.sh

```
/home/pi/RetroCRT/retrocrt_resolutions.csv
```

# Reporting Issues

GitHub.com has built-in issue tracking.

If you don't want to sign up for GitHub.com, join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/RetroPieCRT/) and post questions or issues there.

# Troubleshooting

Most issues can be solved by re-running the installer via the RetroPie menu.  This will apply, or re-apply, all necessary changes.  Simply select 'RetroCRT' from the RetroPie section of EmulationStation.



## DIY

I'm assuming you're able to SSH in, or have a monitor & keyboard. I typically connect my Pi via Ethernet when I'm first configuring it for ease.

You can also do the initial configuration with a monitor hooked up to HDMI.

* [Enabling SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) on the official Raspbian docs.
  * This is best solved by putting your SD card in another machine and creating an empty file called 'ssh' in the boot partition.
* [Wireless Connectivity](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/README.md) is an option, but I prefer wired for simplicity.
* SSH Clients
  * [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/windows.md)
  * [Linux & macOS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md)

You can cut & paste this into your terminal.

```
cd &&
git clone https://github.com/xovox/RetroCRT &&
cd RetroCRT &&
/bin/bash ./retrocrt_setup.sh
```

# Footnotes

I am not affiliated with Mike Chi & RetroTink.

Shout out to [Vykran](https://github.com/Vykyan/retroTINK-setup) for the initial groundwork, though he seems to be PAL & I'm NTSC... which brought us to where we are now.
